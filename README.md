Tasks :

1. Implement histogram equalization for an given image
2. Two matrices are given one is a bigger (W) another square of size 3X3 (K).  Now we have to implement the following operations to get the resultant matrix R.
   Write a program to compute R. Follow the operations given in the R carefully. The other operations are similar.
   Extend the program for any size of K provided K is a square one.
