CV_Assignment_1 Tasks :

1. Compute the standard deviation, mean, mode and median of an image
2. Compute the frequency of each intensity level from an image
3. Intensity slicing of an image
4. Read an image and convert that to gray if it is color. 
   Find the connected regions of the image with exact and some precision following 4, 8 and diagonal connectivity


CV_Assignment_2 Tasks :

1. Implement histogram equalization for an given image
2. Two matrices are given one is a bigger (W) another square of size 3X3 (K).  Now we have to implement the following operations to get the resultant matrix R.
   Write a program to compute R. Follow the operations given in the R carefully. The other operations are similar.
   Extend the program for any size of K provided K is a square one.
